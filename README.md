## Myrient Index and Download Tips
This bot can use the open directory at [Myrient](https://myrient.erista.me/) to fetch download links. Because the site does not provide search, run `scripts/update_myrient_index.py` to build a local index of all files. The script crawls the site using Python and requires network access. The generated file is stored at `data/myrient_index.txt`.
If a crawl is interrupted, rerunning the script will prompt you to resume from the last saved location or start over.

Large files can be downloaded with any of the managers recommended on Myrient's wiki:

- DownThemAll (recommended)
- JDownloader or Motrix
- aria2 or wget
- Searches restrict matches to the exact console directory to avoid cross-platform results
- Common aliases like "PS2" or "N64" are recognized automatically
